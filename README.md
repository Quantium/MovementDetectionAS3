MovementDetectionAS3
====================

Old code about Movement Detection techniques in ActionScript 3

This is just a simple experiment I made a few years ago.

In the file MovementDetection.as in the 39 to 41 lines you can select wich method to use.

You need to switch between 45 and 46 to change the filter to use depending on with method you previously select, and between lines and 50 and 51 to use a Diff Drawer.

See the nested Classes to understand more.

If you have Questions ask it here in github and I will be glad to answer.

This experiments includes the Flave by Luiz Fernando library, there is a copy of the correct version here.

A simple demonstration of this code can be viewed in this youtube video: http://youtu.be/VOQVHKK9goE
